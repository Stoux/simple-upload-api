# Simple Upload: API

An ultra basic api that has the ability to receive files from a client.  

Uses a header API key for authentication.
Probably still contains a bunch of boilerplate that I was to lazy to remove.

Tightly coupled with [Android app project](https://github.com/Stoux/simple-upload-app).
